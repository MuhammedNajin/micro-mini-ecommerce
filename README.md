Mini-eCommerce Project




A mini-eCommerce application built using a microservices architecture with Kafka as a message broker. This project consists of 5 services:

User Service
Auth Service
Admin Service
Cart Service
Product Service
Each service is independently deployable and communicates via Kafka topics for event-driven data exchange.

Features
User Management: Sign up, login, and manage profiles.
Authentication: JWT-based authentication for secure access.
Admin Portal: Manage products, categories, and users.
Shopping Cart: Add, update, or remove products from the cart.
Kafka Integration: Asynchronous messaging between services.
Scalable Microservices: Each service runs independently and can be scaled as needed.
